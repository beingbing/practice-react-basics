This is a react practice project, in which i used only bare minimum basic knowledge of
React components with CSS Module and useState hook, to create a completely independent
and working Form submission and list display application.

What i Learned -
1. How React Components interact with each other
2. passing information among components in both directions, that is, up and down the DOM tree
3. useState hook to maintain component state
4. how to add CSS using CSS Module
5. props.children property of every component
6. bootstrapping a react application
